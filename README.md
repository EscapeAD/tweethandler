# Tweet Analyzer
  Reads CSV uploads to checks sentiment / sortable by filters and etc.

  - using Dandelion api ( I modify gem as original gem had issues )
    "https://github.com/EscapeAD/dandelionapi-ruby"
  - using action-cable // actions will effect all uses except sort and filter
  - Based on provided twitter dump file

Due to api limit of free - changed it to web application sync with all browsers

Features:
```
- sorta by clicking language/type/sentiment
- additional filter type options
- websocket: sync all browsers
- csv format check
- notification upon hitting api limit
```
